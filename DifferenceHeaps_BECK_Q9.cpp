 Using max-heap we can run this algorithm at O(1), but for n values, we still need
 to compare adjacent values from 0 to n-1 to find the minimal value, O(n) worst case. 
 We could stop with the vector array of ints at value 2 and 2 since the absolute minimal 
 value is 0, in which we cannot get any smaller and this would run O(1) in the minDiff() 
 function. However, to be thorough, I wanted to print all of the pairs of values that also
 contain the minimal possible difference.
